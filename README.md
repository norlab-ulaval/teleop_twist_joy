Modified version of the teleop_twist_joy package for the warthog. See [ROS Wiki](http://wiki.ros.org/teleop_twist_joy).

======================

This package is modified to work with a [FORT Robotics Safe Remote Control System](https://autonomoustuff.com/product/fort-remote-control-system/). It also includes a single-hand control mapping as well as direct wheel velocity control.
